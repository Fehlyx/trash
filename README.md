Hi there!
A short explanation to all the python files here:


Age-Check
Age-Check.py is a programm to determine, what the appropriate age spectrum for you to date is, without mental arithmetic. It uses the "half-your-age-plus-seven" rule. It also has some other cool features like telling you how many years to wait until your potential partner is in your age spectrum.

Ratespiel.py
Ratespiel.py is a game in german where you can guess a random number between 1 and 100 in the terminal.

7Rule.py
7Rule.py is a very short version of Age-Check.py, without any features.

Temperatur.py
Temperatur.py converts Fahrenheit into Celsius and the other way round.


Have fun!
